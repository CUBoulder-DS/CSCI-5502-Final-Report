# Source Code Folder

This is where all code files relating to analysis, data exploration etc go; they DO NOT go in the `quarto-paper` folder in order to keep that clean. This way, we can separate the coding work from the work that went into the actual writing of the paper.

## Files

- **`model_code/`**: Where the code from other repos for solving the NeurIPS challenge goes
- **`model_code/NeurIPS-Education-Challenge-2020`**: Best winner for Task 1, Task 3 (tie)
- **`model_code/TOP1-for-task-2-in-the-NeurIPS-2020-Education-Challenge`**: Best winner for Task 2
- **`model_code/NeurIPSEducation2020`**: Best winner for Task 4
