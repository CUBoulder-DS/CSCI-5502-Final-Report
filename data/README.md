# Data Folder

This is where the data goes, that is outputted by our code or that we download (that is small enough to fit under the stupid Github limits).

## Eedi Dataset

The pdf of description of the dataset features, and the tasks assigned in the NeurIPS Challenge, is at `Eedi_dataset/Eedi_Dataset_and_Tasks_Desc.pdf`.

Since the Eedi dataset has files too large (`Eedi_dataset/metadata/answer_metadata_task_1_2.csv` and `Eedi_dataset/train_data/train_task_1_2.csv`) to commit to github, **follow the following steps to get the full dataset**:

1. Download the dataset from [this site](https://eedi.com/projects/neurips-education-challenge) (or directly from this [download link](https://dqanonymousdata.blob.core.windows.net/neurips-public/data.zip))
1. Unzip to the `Eedi_dataset` folder
1. Do ignore/don't replace for existing files, the 2 large files should now be added
