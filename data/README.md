# Data Folder

This is where the data goes, that is outputted by our code or that we download (that is small enough to fit under the stupid Github limits).

SINCE the Eedi dataset has files too large (`Eedi_dataset/metadata/answer_metadata_task_1_2.csv` and `Eedi_dataset/train_data/train_task_1_2.csv`) to commit to github, follow the following steps to get the full dataset:

1. Download the dataset from [this site](https://eedi.com/projects/neurips-education-challenge) (or directly from this [download link](https://dqanonymousdata.blob.core.windows.net/neurips-public/data.zip))
1. Unzip to the `Eedi_dataset` folder
1. Do ignore/don't replace for existing files, the 2 large files should now be added
